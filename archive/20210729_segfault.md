### [Runtime Systems Engineer (India, Remote)](https://segfault.systems/runtime_systems_engineer.html)

The [Multicore OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore) project aims to bring native support for scalable concurrency and shared memory parallelism to the OCaml programming language. At its core, Multicore OCaml extends OCaml with [effect handlers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00250) for expressing scalable concurrency, and a [high-performance concurrent garbage collector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11663) aimed at responsive networked applications. Multicore OCaml is also the first industrial-strength language to be equipped with [an efficient yet modular memory model](https://kcsrk.info/papers/pldi18-memory.pdf), allowing high-level local program reasoning while retaining performance. Multicore OCaml is actively being developed and core features are being [upstreamed to OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pulls?q=label%3Amulticore-prerequisite+).

### [Compiler Reliability Engineer (India, Remote)](https://segfault.systems/compiler_reliability_engineer.html)

The [Multicore OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore) project aims to bring native support for scalable concurrency and shared memory parallelism to the OCaml programming language. At its core, Multicore OCaml extends OCaml with [effect handlers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00250) for expressing scalable concurrency, and a [high-performance concurrent garbage collector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11663) aimed at responsive networked applications. Multicore OCaml is also the first industrial-strength language to be equipped with [an efficient yet modular memory model](https://kcsrk.info/papers/pldi18-memory.pdf), allowing high-level local program reasoning while retaining performance. Multicore OCaml is actively being developed and core features are being [upstreamed to OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pulls?q=label%3Amulticore-prerequisite+).

As we get closer to releasing OCaml 5.0 with Multicore support, there is a need to _**ensure that the multicore support works well with the rest of the ecosystem**_. The ecosystem includes the open-source tools and libraries maintained by the Multicore team as well as the wider ecosystem. We have built a number of tools to assist with the task at hand. Some of the tools are:

*   [OPAM Health Check](http://check.ocamllabs.io:8082/) shows the result of building the packages from the [OPAM repo](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/). The table shows the result of building the package and running its opam tests (if present) on the [stock OCaml compiler](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml) and the domains-only version of the multicore compiler. Any failure in the multicore column with a success in the stock column must be investigated.
*   [Multicore OCurrent CI](https://multicore.ci.ocamllabs.io:8100/) tests a matrix of blessed packages that the multicore team considers important for the ecosystem. Unlike OPAM health check, the packages and the compiler variants may be unreleased and part of other development branches in GitHub. This tool builds the workflow as a dependency graph of individual build tasks. The individual tasks will be rebuilt on demand when the corresponding item being tracked (say the branch on GitHub) is updated.

#### Responsibilities

As a compiler reliability engineer, your tasks will include:

*   Investigating failures thrown up by OPAM Health Check monitoring and deeper package testsuite runs with multicore. Determine if the issue is a problem for the package maintainer or the multicore compiler.
*   File issues and work with the relevant team (external or multicore) to get it fixed by producing reproducible test cases possibly even identifying the subsystem where the problem is occurring.
*   Help organise and link ocaml-multicore bug reports such that issues are correctly linked or merged.
*   Provide support to the multicore team in understanding which bugs and/or features external packages require in order to function well.
*   Work with the rest of the CI team to ensure that the multicore CI systems are running as expected.

#### Qualification & Experience

_(You donâ€™t have to fill 100% of the qualifications to apply.)_

*   Demonstrable experience with existing open source projects
*   Ideally some level of experience with the OCaml language, or other functional programming languages
*   Experience with GitHub, Git and version control
*   Ideally some experience with the OCaml platform ecosystem e.g. dune, opam
*   Domain knowledge relevant to the projects - package management, CI and build environments, developer workflow and processes
*   Curious and solution-oriented mindset
*   Experience of working within multidisciplinary and remote teams
*   Good communication skills in English (English is the corporate language)

#### What we offer

*   Competitive pay and benefits package.
*   Flexible working hours and the possibility to work remotely within India.
*   Supportive team environment with experienced Technical and Team Leads.
*   The opportunity to grow with a fast-growing company.

#### Apply

Please send your CV and cover letter to **jobs@segfault.systems**.

If shortlisted, you will have three online interviews starting with a general interview, followed by a technical interview, and finally an interview with the team.

We welcome applications from people of all backgrounds. We strive to create a representative, inclusive and friendly team, because we know that different experiences, perspectives and backgrounds make for a better workplace.

### [Multicore Application Engineer (India, Remote)](https://segfault.systems/multicore_application_engineer.html)

The [Multicore OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore) project aims to bring native support for scalable concurrency and shared memory parallelism to the OCaml programming language. At its core, Multicore OCaml extends OCaml with [effect handlers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00250) for expressing scalable concurrency, and a [high-performance concurrent garbage collector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11663) aimed at responsive networked applications. Multicore OCaml is also the first industrial-strength language to be equipped with [an efficient yet modular memory model](https://kcsrk.info/papers/pldi18-memory.pdf), allowing high-level local program reasoning while retaining performance. Multicore OCaml is actively being developed and core features are being [upstreamed to OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pulls?q=label%3Amulticore-prerequisite+).

As OCaml 5.0 with shared-memory parallelism support is on the horizon, we are ready to build full-fledged OCaml applications that take advantage of the parallelism opportunities. Specifically, the focus is on the [Tezos blockchain](https://tezos.com/) to improve the transaction throughput, utilising the parallelism support. We believe that adding parallelism support to a complex project such as the Tezos shell would set a precedent for how other projects should utilise parallelism support and help identify pain points that the Multicore OCaml team and the wider community can address.

We are looking for an experienced engineer (3y+) to build parallel applications using the Multicore OCaml compiler. Ideally, you will have:

#### Qualifications & Experience

_(You donâ€™t have to fill 100% of the qualifications to apply.)_

*   Excellent knowledge and hands-on experience developing parallel programs in any language.
*   Experience with the OCaml language, or other functional programming languages.
*   Experience in analysing benchmarks and application performance.
*   Track record of building production quality software.
*   Demonstrable open source contributions are a plus, but not required.
*   Good communication skills in English; English is the corporate language.
*   Experience of working in multidisciplinary teams.

#### Responsibilities

*   Ecosystem Engineering
    *   Build and maintain Tezos node using the Multicore OCaml compiler.
    *   Add Tezos related packages to the [OCaml CI](https://multicore.ci.ocamllabs.io:8100/)
    *   Investigate CI failures and report issues to appropriate teams
*   Parallelising
    *   Work with the Tezos developers to identify the opportunities for parallelism in the Tezos shell.
    *   Utilise Multicore OCaml parallelism support (such as [Lwt offloading](https://sudha247.github.io/2020/10/01/lwt-multicore/) mechanism) to offload compute-intensive tasks such as crypto and serialisation to spare cores.
    *   Work with the [Irmin](https://irmin.org/)/Tezos storage team to add parallelism to storage tasks.
*   Benchmarking
    *   Work with the Tezos developers and Irmin team to identify relevant benchmarks.
    *   Implement those benchmarks for Tezos, and work with the benchmarking team to include them in [sandmark](https://github.com/ocaml-bench/sandmark) and continuous benchmarking infrastructures.
*   Research
    *   Build a direct-style Tezos shell using the [eio](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio), next-generation effect-based direct-style io library.
    *   Collaborate with researchers to implement deterministic parallelism support in the Tezos protocol core.

#### What we offer

*   Competitive pay and benefits package.
*   Flexible working hours and the possibility to work remotely within India.
