# Jobs at Unison Computing

Unison Computing is a seed stage startup and a [public benefit corp](https://www.unisonweb.org/2020/03/30/benefit-corp-report/). Our overall mission: [radically advance what’s possible with software, and make the creation of software accessible to everyone](https://www.unisonweb.org/2020/03/30/benefit-corp-report/). The company researches and develops new open-source programming technology and builds products on this new technology. Our current projects are the open source [Unison language](http://unisonweb.org/) and the commercial [Unison Cloud Platform](http://unison.cloud/).

See the [Unison Strange Loop talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCWtkvDQ2ZI) for an introduction to the core ideas behind Unison and also [the Unison documentation site](https://unisonweb.org/docs) for more about the Unison language.

## Developer Experience Lead

We're looking for a Developer Experience Lead to design and build new open source programming tools for Unison. In this role, you'll work on delightful practical tools for Unison and its current users, and also do futuristic research and experimentation on new interfaces to programming that empower billions of people to learn programming. We envision a world where powerful programming tools exist that are simple enough to teach to people of all ages and where basic programming skill is as common as literacy.

We see a lot of low-hanging fruit in simplifying or [reducing the learning curve of traditional programming](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/). To take just one example, programs are typically represented and stored as collections of text files. But most blobs of text don't even parse or typecheck as programs, so newcomers to programming spend a lot of time deciphering obscure errors coming back from the compiler, until they develop a "mental parser and typechecker". That's an awful lot to ask of newcomers to programming. How many would-be programmers never get over the hump?

In Unison, a codebase is represented as a database of definitions stored as their abstract syntax tree, rather than a bag of text files (see [the Strange Loop talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCWtkvDQ2ZI) for more of an intro to this idea and its benefits), so we can easily present multiple interfaces and syntaxes for the same underlying programming model. Likewise, building alternate programming UIs is low risk and might be used initially by a small number of Unison programmers. (Bob might write Unison code in a text buffer using Python-like syntax, an 8 year old kid Betsy might write Unison in a Scratch-like environment, and Alice might view and edit Bob and Betsy's code in a different editor using a Haskell-like syntax!)

We could imagine a more constrained programming UI in which programs would parse and typecheck by construction. No more obscure compile errors! Here was an early rough prototype we built to explore this idea. In the lower right is the same program written in a regular text editor.

Perhaps this kind of thing could make programming more accessible to newcomers, but it also raises questions about how such interfaces can be made fluid and move through intermediate states that may not correspond to valid programs. (Just as it's not a great UX to be shown obscure type errors, it's also not a great UX to have a highly constrained interface where it's unclear how to move from one state to another) There's also just basic mechanics of how such an interface can be made to feel fluid. 

This is just one example of the kind of challenging and fun problems you'd get to work on as part of your role.

### Inspiration

What are your sources of inspiration? Here are some of ours:

- Any of Bret Victor's work, including his [Learnable Programming](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/) essay and the [Future of Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4) talk
- Conal Elliott's [Tangible Functional Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faJ8N0giqzw) work
- The Smalltalk language and editing environments (see this [excellent talk on what's cool about Smalltalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baxtyeFVn3w))
- The [Hazel language](https://hazel.org/) by Cyrus Omar and friends

### Important traits and skills for this role

We don't want people who just make things look good, but people who want to design interactions that make users feel good while using them. We want software development to be frictionless and delightful! 

It's ideal if you are someone who enjoys taking the lead on crafting an amazing user experience for any developer tool you build, rather than needing a product manager to tell you what the user experience should be. We will be there for you to provide guidance and offer direction, but you should feel excited to bring your own ideas about what would be awesome.

We love statically-typed functional languages such as Elm, PureScript, Scala, Haskell, and Unison itself. We hope that you'll be excited to learn about them if you haven't already.

We're committed to building a friendly, welcoming, and diverse community of Unison programmers, and it's important to us that you commit to this as well.

And probably the most important trait for this role is: enthusiasm for making computing better, a belief that the (computing) world is what we make of it, and an ability and willingness to learn whatever is necessary to make a new vision of computing a reality. Regardless of your past experience, you will often find yourself in uncharted territory. We think that's awesome and part of the fun and hope you do as well!

### Logistics

We are based in [Somerville, MA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Square), but we have employees in other parts of the US, and we are comfortably working remotely. (And, since COVID, we have all been working from home.) Although we ask that some working hours overlap with a 9-5 [EDT](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/edt) work day, we also recognize that our team members are also parents, hobbyists, family members, and community members, and we are happy that our flexibility allows us to flourish both professionally and personally.

The company offers competitive benefits and a vacation policy that emphasizes work/life balance.

### How to apply

Send an email to jobs@unison.cloud. Here's what to include:

- Tell us who you are and why you want to work on Unison.
- Include your résumé/CV or a link to it (LinkedIn is fine).
- Let us know your preferred technologies for front-end development.
- Please provide examples of your UI work.
- If you have any examples of publications you've made, talks you've given, articles or blog posts you've written, or anything else you want to share with us, we'd love to see!
- Let us know where you are currently based.
- What questions do you have about the role?

We look forward to hearing from you!
