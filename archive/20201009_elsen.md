# [JOB] Elsen is hiring a remote Haskell engineer

Elsen ([elsen.co](https://elsen.co)) is looking for a remote full-time senior Haskell engineer.

## Description

This position offers an opportunity to work with a global team responsible for building the future of financial data management and analysis. Elsen is on a fast-paced transformation to expand our cloud data integration, management, and analytics applications.

Your primary goals will be building software tools and product features that make it easier for our clients to access data and build new quantitative investment solutions.

## Location

The position is fully remote and you can work from anywhere in the world as long as your working hours can include 10:00-14:00 Eastern Time (14:00 - 18:00 UTC).

## Responsibilities

* Work with stakeholders to negotiate specifications and requirements of new product features
* Improve the performance of Elsen's proprietary language and implement new language features
* Design and implement data models, runtime DB queries, migrations and application-side logic
* Work with other teams (cloud ops, data engineers, and frontend engineers) to support their activity and architectural improvements
* Access and analyze logs and usage metrics from client environments to solve issues
* Assist customer support team in responding to issues and answer questions when escalated to the backend team

## Qualifications

* 3+ years of experience as a software developer using Haskell or other statically typed functional programming language (F#, OCaml)
* Experience building sophisticated and highly automated software for distributed processing systems
* Strong understanding of relational database concepts, including performance optimization
* Solid understanding of parallel and concurrent programming techniques
* Knowledge about API design standards, patterns and best-practices
* (Preferred) Experience with designing and implementation of domain specific languages
* (Preferred) Knowledge of finance, quantitative modeling, market data, simulations, etc.
* (Preferred) Experience with PostgreSQL and other cloud-based relational databases

## Tech Stack

Our backend is written entirely in Haskell, including the interpreter for Elsen's proprietary programming language, the API service and all the background automation. The application data is stored in Postgres.

We make an effort to build the code on simpler Haskell idioms as much as it makes sense, but we also don't shy away from using any advanced techniques whenever the benefits in safety, conciseness or performance convincingly justify their use.

We depend on a lot of excellent Haskell packages, but the subset in the following list should give an idea about the main architectural direction:

* Most of our endpoints are implemented with scotty, but some others use servant
* We use mtl for the monadic glue, but we don't try to glue everything with monads
* We use plain record syntax for simple cases and lens for more nested structures occasionally powered by generic-lens
* A lot of the performance-critical code makes heavy use of vector
* We mostly use postgresql-simple and postgresql-query to talk to the DB

## Salary

The yearly salary will be in the range USD 110,000 - 150,000 depending on your seniority level

To apply, please send a cover letter and a resume to [jobs@elsen.co](mailto:jobs@elsen.co).
